# trading-experiment

This is an experimental project that helps with Binance trading, written for Google Apps Script.

The project is in the early alpha state and is being tested right now.

The current features are:
* Integration with Trading View notifications to buy or sell coins.
* A moving stop-loss limit, which goes up together with the price.
* A simple plot of currently tracked assets and the total profit counter.

**The usage and best-practice advices will be provided once it is graduated to beta.**
